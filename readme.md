The OS keyboard layout should be set to Spanish so the above image matches the actual keys.

Some ideas that shaped this layout:

    There are 4 layers: Base, Upper (△), Right (▷), and Upper Right (△ + ▷).
    The base layer is almost the same as the one on the default Corne layout when the keyboard is set to Spanish on the OS (the only differences being RShift instead of Esc, and LAlt instead of Alt Gr).
    When the Upper layer (△) is selected, the right hand resting position matches the one on the arrow keys on a traditional keyboard.
    The right half of the keyboard can be used as a numpad with only the right hand by selecting the Right layer (▷).
    The only keys missing from a full-size (105 keys) Spanish keyboard are the interpunct (· or Shift + 3), Scroll Lock, and Num Lock. I never use them (does anybody?) and I'd rather not include them and risk toggling Scroll/Num Lock by accident.
    Media keys are not present because I find it better to use keyboard + mouse shortcuts with AutoHotkey (e.g: Ctrl + Shift + Wheel Up/Wheel Down increases/decreases the volume).
